This ASCII file is to contain a description of any known problems or issues with your 
assignment. If you know something doesn't work or you assignment is incomplete document
it here so that the markers don't waste time trying to figure out if there is 
some sort of build problem or issue when it is simply the case that things aren't
working.

 I've got 99 problems but a bit ain't one."

We actually have several problems, but it sorta runs!

1. Trampoline: We could not figure out why our trampoline code won't trampoline
               into user code. We thing the groundwork is there, but there might be
               something we've overlooked

2. low level kbd: The lower level keyboard's "device" struct is staticaly set.
                  That is, we've manually set the address to run when open is called
                  for example.

3. Masking: bit masking is not working properly. The higher numbered signals still
            get priority though.

4. kbd read: read does not work because we could not figure out how to use the port numbers

5. Interrupts: we could not get interrupt working properly in assignment 2. Since there was
               no clean code for us to work on, interrupts are still not working properly

6. A1 and A2: We ported nothing from A1 and A2 because we could not get either working 100%
